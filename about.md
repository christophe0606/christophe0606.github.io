# Welcome to my blog !

I am French. I have been working for more than 20 years at the intersection of software, mathematics and hardware.

And this blog will be about the topics that I like : maths, physics, computer science and a more recent interest in algorithmic art.

During my free time, I like to build stuff like this acoustic levitator:

I like to program, read scientific books, make 3D printed objects or algorithmic art like this portrait of me:
